Ever wondered which chess openings work well in real-life games compared to computer evaluation? These figures may help!
* Each point represents one of ~3,400 chess openings, and the size represents the number of games played on Lichess
* x axis: the computer evaluation of the opening position in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value" target="_blank">centipawns</a>. Positive values are evaluated to be 
better for white, and negative values are evaluated to be better for black
* y axis: the proportion of wins for white in games played on Lichess. See the left panel to consider only games played under specific time controls
* Each point can be clicked to open a computer analysis link

Enjoy!
